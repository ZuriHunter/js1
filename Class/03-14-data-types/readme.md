## Learning Objectives

- Describe the concept of a "data type" and how it relates to variables.
- Declare, assign to, and manipulate data stored in a variable.
- Iterate over and and manipulate values in an array.

>Last class, we worked on using basic commands in the terminal, writing some JavaScript and working with Git and Github.

Take a look at some simple keyboard shortcuts to practice:

| **Keypress**    | **Action** |
|-----------------|-------------|
|Ctrl + A|  Go to the beginning of the line you are currently typing on
|Ctrl + E|  Go to the end of the line you are currently typing on
|Ctrl + L|  Clears the Screen, similar to the clear command
|Ctrl + U|  Clears the line before the cursor position. If you are at the end of the line, clears the entire line.
|Ctrl + H|  Same as backspace
|Ctrl + R|  Let’s you search through previously used commands
|Ctrl + C|  Kill whatever you are running
|Ctrl + D|  Exit the current shell
|Ctrl + Z|  Puts whatever you are running into a suspended background process. fg restores it.
|Ctrl + W|  Delete the word before the cursor
|Ctrl + K|  Clear the line after the cursor
|Ctrl + T|  Swap the last two characters before the cursor
|Tab    |   Auto-complete files and folder names

## What is a Data Type? (10 min)

Let's jump into today's lesson - data types! We'll learn the basics of JavaScript and how to pass data around. When we think about building any sort of app, we want to be able to pass data around. This all starts with data types! But what are data types? In computer science and computer programming, a data type is a classification identifying one of various types of data. Using data types, we can determine 1) the possible values for that type 2) the operations that can be done on values of that type 3) the meaning of the data; and the way values of that type can be stored.

Maybe you've already encountered data types before! Data types are really similar across different languages:

| Data Type | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Strings | Single words or sentences, surrounded by double or single quotes | `"lots of kittens"`, `'lots of kittens'` |
| Integers | Whole numbers, with no delimiter. Can optionally have underscores to make large numbers easier to read | `42`, `1024`, `1\_000\_000` |
| Floats | Decimals, with no delimiter | `3.14`, `3.0` |
| Booleans | Represents either true or false | `true`, `false` |
| Arrays | Ordered collections of Data | [ "superman", "batman", "spiderman"] |
| Objects | Unordered collections of Data | {name: "Jesse", age: 27} |

We'll elaborate on all these- except Booleans, Arrays and Objects (for now) - and talk about how they differ in JavaScript, show you how to work with each type, and then, practice what are known as helper methods to manipulate this data.

#### Working with Data in JavaScript

JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements...client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.

### Think-Pair-Share: Identify JS Features in Cookie Clicker

Think: Spend three minutes playing around with [Cookie Clicker](http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) and think about the following questions...

- What Cookie Clicker features are (or are not!) powered by Javascript?
- What categories of functionality does Javascript give a web app?
- Why would you say a particular feature is powered by Javascript as opposed to HTML or CSS?

Pair: Spend another three minutes discussing and comparing your findings with a partner.

Share: We'll discuss our findings as a class.

## Datatypes (15 min)

For this lesson, we're going to use the Terminal and Node to run some basic scripts to understand the types of data we're working with.  Open the terminal and type in ```node```.

#### Part 1: typeof

The computer knows what type of data we're working with, so why don't we ask it? To know what type of data we're dealing with, we can use [`typeof`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof).  Let's try it out in the terminal with the following:

  ```javascript
  typeof 37 === 'number';
  => true

  typeof {} === 'object';
  => true

  typeof 'hi there' === 'string';
  => true

  ```
  `typeof` returns a string with the type of the operand, or expression of the object you're looking at.


>More about objects in the second half of this class!

#### Part 2: Numbers

Numbers are divided into two classes:

* Integers (a.k.a. "whole numbers")

  ```javascript
   ..., -1,0, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
  ```

* Floats (or Decimal numbers)

  ```javascript
   2.718, 3.14, .5, .25, etc
  ```

In JavaScript, these data points are the same **type** of object, which it calls *Numbers*, so don't be surprised when ``typeof( )`` doesn't return 'float' and 'integer.'


#### Part 3: Arithmetic Operators

Operators are used to work with data in JavaScript. The standard [arithmetic operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators#Arithmetic_operators) - that you've been learning since grade school - are supported, including addition, subtraction, division and so forth. Check it out:

```javascript
1 + 2
=> 3

2 - 5
=> -3

5 / 2
=> 2.5

6 * 2
=> 12

6 % 3
=> 0

7 % 3
=> 1

8 % 3
=> 2
```

#### Part 4: Special Number Operators

JavaScript can be a little cheap with the number of operations it allows you to do. For example, how is someone supposed to square a number or cube a number easily? Luckily there is a special `Math` object with some very useful methods.

* Taking a number to some `power`? Then just use `Math.pow`

    ```javascript
    // 3^2 becomes
    Math.pow(3,2)
    => 4
    // 2^4 becomes
    Math.pow(2,4)
    => 16
    ```
* Taking a square root

    ```javascript
    // √(4) becomes
    Math.sqrt(4)
    => 2
    ```
* Need a `random` number? Then use `Math.random`.

    ```javascript
    // The following only returns a random decimal
    Math.random()
    => .229375290430
    /**
      The following will return a
      random number between 0 and 10
    */
    Math.random()*10
    ```

* Since Numbers can be **Floats** or **Integers**, we often want to get rid of remaining decimal places, which can be done using `Math.floor`.

    ```javascript
    // Remove the decimal
    Math.floor(3.14)
    => 3
    Math.floor(3.9999)
    => 3
    ```

#### Part 5: Strings

Strings are collections of letters and symbols known as *characters*, and we use them to deal with words and text in JavaScript. Strings are just another type of **value** in Javascript.

  ```javascript
  "John"
  "Jane"
  "123"
  ```

## Variables and Keywords (15 min)

Variables are used to store data types into the memory of the computer so that they can be referenced later.

#### Part 1: Always use var!

We'll talk more about why next week with scopes.

New variables in JavaScript are declared using the [`var`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var "/en/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/var") keyword.

If you declare a variable without assigning any value to it, its type is `undefined`.

```javascript
var a;
=> undefined
```

So lets try assigning a value to variable:

```javascript
var name = "Alex";
=> undefined

name
=> "Alex"
```

Having made some expressions it becomes evident we may want to store these values.

```javascript
var myNumber = 1;
// or also

var myString = "Greetings y'all!"
```

The main note to make here is that these variables should always have the `var` keyword and use `camelCase`

#### Part 2: Assignment Operators

Values are assigned using `=`, and there are also compound assignment statements such as `+=` and `-=`:

```javascript
var x = 1;
=> 1

x += 5
=> 6

// (x += 1) === (x = x + 1) === (x++)
```

You can use `++` and `--` to increment and decrement by 1, respectively. These can be used as prefix or postfix operators.

In Javascript, we just discussed two types of values we can use. We call these values objects, which for now just means that in addition to storing some data, you also get to use some helpful methods when you are working with them.

* If you want to turn a number into a string you can use a helpful method called `toString`.

## Introduction to Arrays (10 min)

You will find that strings and numbers are often not enough for most programming purposes. What is needed are collections of data that we can use efficiently, Arrays.

Arrays are great for:

* Storing ordered data
* Enumerating data, i.e. using an index to find them
* Quickly reordering data

Arrays, ultimately, are a data structure that is similar in concept to a list. Each item in an array is called an element, and the collection can contain data of the same or different types. In JavaScript, they can dynamically grow and shrink in size.


  ```javascript
  var friends = ['Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly'];
  => ['Moe', 'Larry', 'Curly']
  ```

Items in an array are stored in sequential order, and indexed starting at `0` and ending at `length - 1`. To be clear, JavaScript starts counting at zero, so the first position in the array will be `[0]`, the second position in the array will be `[1]` and so forth.

  ```javascript
  // First friend
  var firstFriend = friends[0];
   => 'Moe'
  // Get the last friend
  var lastFriend = friends[2]
  => 'Curly'
  ```

We can even use strings like arrays:

  ```javascript
  var friend = "bobby bottleservice";
  // pick out first character
  friend[0]
  //=> 'b'
  friend.length
  ```

## Accessing Values in Arrays (20 min)

This exercise concerns getting and setting array indices, as well as continued practice with string concatenation. Students will be populating two arrays, one with strings, the other numbers. Students will then return these strings and numbers from the arrays in order to create sentences.

#### Part 1: Creating arrays using the `new` keyword and the array literal

Create two arrays; one using the `new` keyword; the other using an array literal.

* The first array will contain __String__ data values, representing goods a student consumes.
* The second array will contain __Number__ data values, representing the quantity of the respective good they consume on a daily basis.

First array (using `new` keyword)

  ```javascript
  var goods = new Array("water", "coffee")
  ```

  Second array (array literal)
  ```javascript
  var quantity = [8, 2]
  ```

Note to the students the differences in array creation (new keyword vs array literal):

```javascript
    var a = [];        // these are the same
    b = new Array();   // a and b are arrays with length 0

    c = ['foo', 'bar'];           // these are the same
    d = new Array('foo', 'bar');  // c and d are arrays with 2 strings

    // these are different:
    e = [3];           // e.length == 1, e[0] == 3
    f = new Array(3);  // f.length == 3, f[0] == undefined
    b = new Array();   // a and b are arrays with length 0

    c = ['foo', 'bar'],           // these are the same
    d = new Array('foo', 'bar'),  // c and d are arrays with 2 strings

```

* Citation: [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1094723/what-is-array-literal-notation-in-javascript-and-when-should-you-use-it)


#### Part 2: Adding elements to the arrays

Add values to the one of the arrays using bracket notation, and use the `.push()` method for the other.

```javascript
goods[2] = "beer"

quantity.push(8)
```

>Note the differences in adding (or setting) array values. What are the pros/cons of each approach?

#### Part 3: Accessing elements from arrays and concatenating them with strings

Now it's time to access various combinations of the two array's elements and concantenate their returned values.

```javascript
  => 'Today, I consumed ' + quantity[0] + ' cups of ' + goods[0]
  => 'I am going to have ' + quantity[1] + ' cups of ' + goods[1] + ' tonight'
```

## Array Helper Methods (20 min)

Arrays come with a number of methods. Here's a list of some popular helpers:

- `a.pop()` - Removes and returns the last item.

- `a.push(item1, ..., itemN)` - `Push` adds one or more items to the end.

- `a.reverse()` - Reverse the array.

- `a.shift()` - Removes and returns the first item.

- `a.unshift([item])` - Prepends items to the start of the array.

Remember, though, you will never remember _every_ method.  Explore the the [full documentation for array methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) and other helper methods given to you for particular objects.

#### Bonus!

Sort the following array using [`.sort`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort):

```javascript
  var countries = [
    ["Cambodia", 15140000],
    ["Vietnam", 89710000],
    ["Laos", 6770000]
  ]
  // 1. sort by population
  // 2. sort alphabetically
  // 3. sort by the last letter of the country
```

#### Part 1: Array Creation and the `.push()` method

```javascript
var message = []

message.push(8)
=> 1
message.push('r', 'e', 'b', 'm', 'u')
=> 6
message.push('n', 's', 'i', 'A', 'G', 'K')
=> 12

message
=> [ 8, 'r', 'e', 'b', 'm', 'u', 'n', 's', 'i', 'A', 'G', 'K' ]

```

#### Part 2: `.pop()`, `.shift()`, and `.unshift()`

```javascript
message.pop()
=> 'K'

message.shift()
=> 8

message.unshift(1)
=> 11
```

#### Part 3: Array reversal using `.reverse()`
```javascript
message.reverse()
=> [ 'G', 'A', 'i', 's', 'n', 'u', 'm', 'b', 'e', 'r', 1 ]
```

> Note: `.reverse()` method mutates the array structure.

#### Part 4: Array `.join()`

The `.join()` method joins all elements of an array into a single string.

Citation: [Mozilla](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/join)

__Note:__ The `.join()` method accepts an optional argument, __the separator__, which becomes a string that separates the array values. If no argument is supplied to `.join()`, the separator defaults to a comma.

```javascript
message.join()
=> 'G,A,i,s,n,u,m,b,e,r,1'

message.join(' ')
=> 'G A i s n u m b e r 1'

```

## Iterating through an Array (20 min)

Iterating through the elements of an array, one at a time, is a very common practice in programming.

We can use a `for` loop to iterate over the elements of an array like this:

```javascript
var teams = ['Bruins', 'Cal Bears', 'Ravens', 'Ducks'];
for (var i = 0; i < teams.length; i++) {
  console.log(i)
	console.log(teams[i]);
}
```

How is the following code following code different from the one above?
```javascript
var teams = ['Bruins', 'Cal Bears', 'Ravens', 'Ducks'];
for (var i = 2; i < teams.length; i++) {
	console.log(teams[i]);
}
```

JavaScript arrays have several advanced _iterator methods_.

Several of these methods require a function be supplied as an argument, and the code you write in the function will be applied to _each_ item in the array, individually.

As an example, lets look at the `forEach` method that we can use instead of a `for` loop to iterate the elements:

```javascript
var teams = ['Bruins', 'Cal Bears', 'Ravens', 'Ducks'];
teams.forEach(function(el) {
    console.log(el);
});
```

This function would return:

```javascript
Bruins
Cal Bears
Ravens
Ducks
```

Notice how much clearer this syntax is than that of the `for` loop?

Here are some other iterator methods for you to research and practice with:

- `Array.filter()`
- `Array.map()`


#### Part 1: Evens and Odds

Create an array, `evens`, and populate it with the even numbers 2 - 10. Create an array, `odds`, and populate it with the odd numbers 1 - 9 .

```javascript
var evens = []
evens.push(2,4,6,8,10)
=> 5

var odds = []
odds.push(1,3,5,7,9)
=> 5
```


#### Part 1: Array.filter( )

The `.filter()` method creates a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function.
[[Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter)]

__Note:__ `.filter()` does not mutate the array it is acting on; while it does return a new array of filtered elements, this new array must be assigned to a new variable or returned to another function.

```javascript
evens.filter(function (num) {
  return num > 5
})
=> [6, 8, 10]

evens
=>[ 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 ]

var bigNums = evens.filter(function (num) {
  return num > 5
})
=> undefined

bigNums
=> [6, 8, 10]

var smallNums = odds.filter(function (num) {
  return num < 5
})
=> undefined
smallNums
=> [1, 3]
```

#### Part 2: Array.map( )

The `.map()` method creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in this array.
[[Source](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map)]

__Note:__ `.map()` does not mutate the array it is acting on; while it does return a new array of filtered elements, this new array must be assigned to a new variable or returned to another function.

```javascript
var timesFive = evens.map(function (num) {
  return num * 5
})
=> undefined

timesFive
=> [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]

var timesTen = odds.map(function (num) {
  return num * 10
})
=> undefined

timesTen
=> [10, 30, 50, 70, 90]
```
